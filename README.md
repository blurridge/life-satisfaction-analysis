# A Gender and Economic-centric Approach on Life Satisfaction

## Context
Second project of mine in Data Analysis and Data Visualization. I used the 
[Suicide rate and Life Expectancy Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marshuu/suicide-rate-and-life-expectancy) for this project.

## Prerequisites
The project uses three libraries which is pandas, matplotlib, and Seaborn.
```
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
```

## Questions asked during the project
1. Which gender is most likely to live longer?
2. Which countries are the happiest? the least happiest?
3. Which countries are the most fertile?
4. Is there a correlation between fertility rate and life expectancy of each gender?
5. Is there a relationship between GDP and the life expectancy of men and women?
6. Is there a connection between GDP and the rate of suicide?
7. Does low happiness score indicate higher suicide rates?
